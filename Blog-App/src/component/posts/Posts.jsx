      title="The Black Holes"
      des="Don't let the name fool you: a black hole is anything but empty space. Rather, it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of New York City. The result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. In recent years, NASA instruments have painted a new picture of these strange objects that are, to many, the most fascinating objects in space.

      title="Pebbles Before Mountains"
      des="With terrestrial experimentation complete, we have begun executing our mitigation strategy on Mars. On Jan. 12 we did a detailed image survey of the ground below Perseverance. This was done so we would have a good idea what rocks and pebbles already exist down there before some more – from our bit carousel – join them in the not-so-distant future.

      title="PEEKABOO! A TINY, HIDDEN GALAXY PROVIDES A PEEK INTO THE PAST"
      des="Peeking out from behind the glare of a bright foreground star, astronomers have uncovered the most extraordinary example yet of a nearby galaxy with characteristics that are more like galaxies in the distant, early universe. Only 1,200 light-years across, the tiny galaxy HIPASS J1131–31 has been nicknamed Peekaboo because of its emergence in the past 50-100 years from behind the fast-moving star that was obscuring astronomers' ability to detect it.

      des="NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has established an extraordinary new benchmark: detecting the light of a star that existed within the first billion years after the universe’s birth in the big bang – the farthest individual star ever seen to date.

      title="THE DARK MATTER CRISIS"
      des="This blog is devoted to pointing out the challenges faced by the dark-matter-based standard model of cosmology, their potential solutions and their implications. As active scientists in this field of research, we can present cutting-edge results, discuss recent publications and provide overviews of the discrepancies that appear when comparing the standard model predictions with observations. We do not leave it at that, but also highlight in detail the serious alternative approaches, based on scientific papers published in peer-reviewed journals. All posts provide links to published works. We also raise sociological aspects of the currently on-going cosmological debate.

      title="Out of this world: The Red Planet"
      des="Unlike the Moon, Mars has a weak atmosphere. Although it is much weaker than our own atmosphere, this allows the potential for water to be present as it less likely to decompose in sunlight and the important hydrogen be lost to space …. Much of the atmosphere on Mars has been lost over time, so just like the Moon it is unlikely that free-flowing water on the surface is feasible.
